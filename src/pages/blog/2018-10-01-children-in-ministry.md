  Kidsministryteam.com is focused on providing tools and resources for equipping
  children in Christian ministry. We believe that kids have access to the same
  Holy Spirit as the most seasoned minister and have giftings and callings from
  God that they can walk in today.

Since I have been involved in children's ministry I have witnessed children praying for and healing the sick, receiving heavenly revelation, preaching in front of congregations, and teaching other kids to do the same. By and large, these kids have not been prodigies or any different than any other kid you may know. They have just been told that they can encounter Jesus and been given a safe place to do so and that's what happens.

```
And it shall come to pass in the last days, says God, That I will pour out of My Spirit on all flesh; Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, Your young men shall see visions, Your old men shall dream dreams. - Acts 2:17 NKJV
```

```
And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover. - Mark 16:17-18 NKJV
```

God has been very generous in pouring out His Spirit on young and old, male and female. The promise of the power of the gospel is to ALL who believe! Our calling as children's ministers goes beyond just ministering to children but to also equip them for the work of ministry.

```
And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ - Ephesians 4:11-12
```
